# Detection of Gleason Pattern from Histopathology of Prostate Cancer Based on Artificial Neural Network

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. The results of a fast and precise classification can be a very important objective of reference. Histological assessment is valuable information for doctors. The most common assessment for histological assessment of prostate cancer is the Gleason Grading System. Gleason pattern detection was done by extracting morphological features in the form of Line Length, Area Fraction, and the comparison between Line Length and Area Fraction. All morphological features become the input of backpropagation. Based on the results of backpropagation testing, this method can classify gleason pattern images with an accuracy of 91.67%. The thresholding segmentation in determining the lumen and nucleus didnâ€™t have a specific range in its threshold due to the lack of uniform contrast in each image.
